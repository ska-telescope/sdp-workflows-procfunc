## Test Batch Workflow

The `test_batch` workflow is designed to test the processing
controller logic concerning processing block dependencies.

The sequence of actions carried out by the workflow is:

* Claims processing block
* Reads value of `duration` parameter (type: float, units: seconds) from processing block
* Sets processing block `status` to `'WAITING'`
* Waits for `resources_available` to be `True`
    * This is the signal from the processing controller that the workflow can start
* Sets processing block `status` to `'RUNNING'`
* Does some "processing" (i.e. sleeps) for the requested duration
* Sets processing block `status` to `'FINISHED'`

The workflow makes no deployments.
