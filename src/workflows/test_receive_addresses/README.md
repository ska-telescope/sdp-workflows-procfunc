## Test Receive Addresses Workflow

### Introduction

The purpose of this workflow is to test the mechanism for generating SDP
receive addresses from the channel link map for each scan type which is
contained in the list of scan types in the SB. The workflow picks it up from
there, uses it to generate the receive addresses for each scan type and writes
them to the processing block state. It consists of a map of scan type to a
receive address map. This address map get publishes to the appropriate
attribute once the SDP subarray finishes the transition following
AssignResources.


### Testing

Start the sdp prototype with (Helm 3 syntax):

```bash
helm install test sdp-prototype
```

Once all the pods are running, connect to the Tango interface using the following command:

```
kubectl exec -it itango-tango-base-test /venv/bin/itango3
```

Obtain a handle to the device with:

```
d = DeviceProxy('mid_sdp/elt/subarray_1')
```


Here is the configuration string for the scheduling block instance:

```
config = '''
{
  "id": "sbi-mvp01-20200318-0001",
  "max_length": 21600.0,
  "scan_types": [
     {
       "id": "science_A",
       "coordinate_system": "ICRS", "ra": "02:42:40.771", "dec": "-00:00:47.84",
       "channels": [{
          "count": 744, "start": 0, "stride": 2, "freq_min": 0.35e9, "freq_max": 0.368e9, "link_map": [[0,0], [200,1], [744,2], [944,3]]
       },{
          "count": 744, "start": 2000, "stride": 1, "freq_min": 0.36e9, "freq_max": 0.368e9, "link_map": [[2000,4], [2200,5]]
       }]
     },
     {
       "id": "calibration_B",
       "coordinate_system": "ICRS", "ra": "12:29:06.699", "dec": "02:03:08.598",
       "channels": [{
          "count": 744, "start": 0, "stride": 2, "freq_min": 0.35e9, "freq_max": 0.368e9, "link_map": [[0,0], [200,1], [744,2], [944,3]]
       },{
          "count": 744, "start": 2000, "stride": 1, "freq_min": 0.36e9, "freq_max": 0.368e9, "link_map": [[2000,4], [2200,5]]
       }]
     }
   ],
  "processing_blocks": [
    {
      "id": "pb-mvp01-20200318-0001",
      "workflow": {"type": "realtime", "id": "test_receive_addresses", "version": "0.3.2"},
      "parameters": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "pb-mvp01-20200318-0002",
      "workflow": {"type": "realtime", "id": "test_realtime", "version": "0.2.0"},
      "parameters": {}
    }
  ]
} '''
```

Start the scheduling block instance by the AssignResources command:

```
d.AssignResources(config)
```

You can connect to the configuration database by running the following command:

``` kubectl exec -it deploy/test-sdp-prototype-console bash ``` and from there to see the full list run ```ska-sdp list -a```

To check if the receive addresses are updated in the processing block state correctly, run the following command:

```
ska-sdp get pb pb-mvp01-20200318-0001/state
```

and the output should look like this:

```
/pb/pb-mvp01-20200318-0001/state = {
  "receive_addresses": {
    "calibration_B": {
      "host": [
        [
          0,
          "192.168.0.1"
        ],
        [
          2000,
          "192.168.0.1"
        ]
      ],
      "port": [
        [
          0,
          9000,
          1
        ],
        [
          2000,
          9000,
          1
        ]
      ]
    },
    "science_A": {
      "host": [
        [
          0,
          "192.168.0.1"
        ],
        [
          2000,
          "192.168.0.1"
        ]
      ],
      "port": [
        [
          0,
          9000,
          1
        ],
        [
          2000,
          9000,
          1
        ]
      ]
    }
  },
  "resources_available": true,
  "status": "RUNNING"
}
```

To access the SBI run this ```ska-sdp get /sb/sbi-mvp01-20200318-0001```

In there you should see that pb_receive_addresses is updated with the PB_ID.

This should now update the receiveAddresses attribute with receive addresses map
and that can be verified by running d.receiveAddresses and the output should look like this:

```
Out[4]: '{"calibration_B": {"host": [[0, "192.168.0.1"], [2000, "192.168.0.1"]], "port": [[0, 9000, 1], [2000, 9000, 1]]}, "science_A": {"host": [[0, "192.168.0.1"], [2000, "192.168.0.1"]], "port": [[0, 9000, 1], [2000, 9000, 1]]}}'
```
