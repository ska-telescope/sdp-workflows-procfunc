Workflow Development
====================

The steps to develop and test an SDP workflow as follows:

- Clone the ska-sdp-science-pipelines repository from GitLab and create a new branch for
  your work.

- Create a directory for your workflow in ``src/workflows``:

  .. code-block::

    $ mkdir src/workflows/<my-workflow>
    $ cd src/workflows/<my-workflow>

- Write the workflow script (``<my-workflow>.py``). See the existing workflows
  for examples of how to do this. The ``test_realtime`` and ``test_batch``
  workflows are the best place to start.

- Create a ``requirements.txt`` file with your workflows's Python requirements,
  e.g.

  .. code-block::

    --index-url https://nexus.engageska-portugal.pt/repository/pypi/simple
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple
    ska-logging
    ska-sdp-workflow

- Create a ``Dockerfile`` for building the workflow image, e.g.

  .. code-block::

    FROM python:3.7

    COPY requirements.txt ./
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

    WORKDIR /app
    COPY <my-workflow>.py ./
    ENTRYPOINT ["python", "<my-workflow>.py"]

- Create a file called ``version.txt`` containing the semantic version number of
  the workflow.

- Create a ``Makefile`` containing

  .. code-block::

    NAME := workflow-<my-workflow>
    VERSION := $(shell cat version.txt)

    include ../../make/Makefile

- Build the workflow image:

  .. code-block::

    $ make build

  This will add it to your local Docker daemon where it can be used for testing
  with a local deployment of the SDP.

  For example with a local installation of ``minikube``

  .. code-block::

     $ eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
     $ make build
     $ make tag_release

  This will point Docker towards the ``minikube`` Docker repository and will then build and
  tag the new workflow accordingly.

- `Deploy SDP locally <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-sdp-integration/en/latest/running/standalone.html>`_
  and `start the console pod <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-sdp-integration/en/latest/running/standalone.html#connecting-to-the-configuration-database>`_.

- Create or import the new workflow into the Configuration DB:

  .. code-block::

    ska-sdp create workflow <type>:<name>:<version> '{"image": <docker image>}'

  .. code-block::

    ska-sdp import my-workflow.json

  `<type>`: batch or realtime, depending on your workflow type

  `<name>`: name of your workflow

  `<version>`: version of your workflow

  `<docker image>`: docker image you just built from your workflow.

  Use import if you have multiple workflows to add to the dB. Example JSON file for
  importing workflows can be found at:
  `Example Workflow JSON <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-sdp-config/en/latest/cli.html#example-workflow-definitions-file-content-for-import>`_

- Then create a processing block to run the workflow, either via the `Tango
  interface <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-sdp-integration/en/latest/running/standalone.html#accessing-the-tango-interface>`_,
  or by creating it directly in the config DB with `ska-sdp create pb <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-sdp-config/en/latest/cli.html#cli-to-interact-with-sdp>`_.

- Once happy with the workflow, add it to the GitLab CI file (``.gitlab-ci.yml``) in the root of the
  repository. This will enable the Docker image to be built and pushed to the
  EngageSKA repository when it is merged into the master branch.

- Add the workflow to the workflow definition file
  ``src/workflows/workflows.json``.

- Commit the changes to your branch and push to GitLab.

Additional steps to build a custom execution engine  (TODO: does this belong here or WL?)
---------------------------------------------------

If you want to use a custom execution engine (EE) in your workflow, the
additional steps you need to do are:

- Create a directory in ``src`` for your EE.

- Add the EE code.

- Build the EE Docker image(s) and push it/them to the Nexus repository.

- Add a Helm chart to deploy the EE containers in ``src/helm_deploy/charts``.

- Add the custom EE deployment to the workflow script.

- Commit changes to your branch and push to GitLab.

- When testing, you also need to point the Helm deployer to your branch of the
  repository:

  .. code-block::

    $ helm install sdp-prototype -n sdp-prototype \
      --set processing_controller.workflows.url=https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp-prototype/raw/<my-branch>/src/workflows/workflows.json \
      --set helm_deploy.chart_repo.ref=<my-branch>
