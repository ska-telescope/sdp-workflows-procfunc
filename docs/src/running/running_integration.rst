Running the SDP Prototype in the integration environment
========================================================

The SDP prototype is being integrated with the prototypes of the other
telescope sub-systems as part of the so-called *Minimum Viable Product*
(MVP).

The integration is done in the `SKA MVP Prototype Integration
(SKAMPI) repository <https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/skampi/>`_.

Instructions for installing and running the MVP can be found in the
`SKAMPI documentation
<https://developer.skatelescope.org/projects/skampi/en/latest/>`_.
